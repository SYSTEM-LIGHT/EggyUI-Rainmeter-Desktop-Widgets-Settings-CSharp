*   **Developer:** Created by [**BSOD-MEMZ**](https://space.bilibili.com/1975308950) and team.  
*   **Purpose:** A powerful personalization theme pack for **Windows Desktop OS**.  
*   **Copyright Statement:**  
    - Derivative work based on NetEase's "Eggy Party" game UI.  
    - All original game assets copyright owned by NetEase.  
    - **Project assets are original recreations or legally obtained; no decompiled game content was used**.  
*   **Style Inspiration:** Deeply replicates the visual style and UI elements of the popular game "Eggy Party", bringing a vibrant and playful gamified interface to Windows desktops.  

## ⚙️ Major Innovations in EggyUI 3.5  
*   **Non-commercial Nature:** This update is **free for personal use only**; commercial exploitation is forbidden.  
*   **Asset Compliance:** All UI elements are recreated from officially released materials, **containing no illegally obtained content**.  
*   **New Installation Model:** The released [**Eggy UI 3.5**](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1kbgGz7Em1) adopts a fundamentally different installation method.  
*   **Introduction of .NET-based Components:**  
    *   Replaced core components originally written in EasyLanguage with .NET framework-based equivalents.  
    *   **Advantages:**  
        - **Enhanced Compatibility:** Fully adapts to modern Windows desktop architecture.  
        - **Improved Stability:** Reduces runtime errors and memory leaks.  
        - **Optimized Performance:** Increases component responsiveness and execution efficiency.  
        - **Better Security:** Lowers security risks and complies with modern standards.  
        - **Easier Maintenance:** Modern framework simplifies future updates.  
*   **System-level Deployment:** Utilizes **new Windows OS installation + unattended auto-deployment** technology.  
*   **Clarification on System Image & Release Timeline:**  
    *   **Rumor Refutation:** The so-called "EggyUI 3.5 image leak incident" is entirely false (stemming from internal developer conflicts).  
    *   **Facts:**  
        - EggyUI 1.0 was released on **July 22, 2024**.  
        - July 22, 2025 marks EggyUI's **1st anniversary**.  
        - The review video was released on **July 21 (one day before the anniversary)** as part of normal promotion.  
        - The image link was added to the video description as planned on **July 22 (anniversary day)**.  
        - **No "leak" occurred**; all releases followed the schedule.  
    *   The EggyUI system image circulating online **is essentially the public test distribution version**; users need not panic.  
    *   System file modifications in the image **underwent rigorous testing** for deep theme integration.  
    *   **Known Edge Cases:** In **rare specific environments** (e.g., system drive assigned as `X:`, non-standard configurations), unattended deployment **may encounter issues**. A minimal number of users (e.g., [Eggy Pidan](https://space.bilibili.com/3493144343612119)) reported issues like "Start Menu not opening". Note: (1) These are extreme edge cases; (2) The image passed strict testing without such issues; (3) Feedback collection for compatibility improvement is ongoing.  
    *   **Critical Recommendation:** While stability is prioritized, **we strongly advise users to prioritize clean Windows installations and apply customization (e.g., Rainmeter widgets) conventionally**. Modifying core system files (even tested ones) **carries higher inherent instability risks than standard customization**. The team acknowledges this, and **an independent EggyUI 3.5 installer for clean systems is in active development** for safer, more flexible deployment.  
*   **Core Advantages:** Through these innovations, EggyUI 3.5 achieves:  
    - ✅ **Compatibility Breakthrough:** Resolves legacy issues (e.g., post-install network configuration failures).  
    - ⚡ **Performance Leap:** Component responsiveness improved by over 40%.  

## 🖥️ Purpose of This Program  
*   **Core Function:** A dedicated tool to **configure, manage, and customize Rainmeter desktop widgets** included in the EggyUI theme pack.  
*   **Terms of Use:** **Personal non-commercial use only**; commercial use prohibited.  
*   **Asset Source:** All graphical resources in widgets are original or legally obtained, **containing no decompiled game content**.  
*   **Scope:** Enables easy adjustment of widget appearance, position, functionality, etc., creating a highly personalized "Eggy Party"-style **Windows desktop environment**.  

## 💡 Summary  
> ⚠️ **Reiteration: We strongly recommend prioritizing clean Windows systems with standard customization methods (e.g., Rainmeter). Using pre-themed modified systems (i.e., system images) carries potential instability risks. The standalone EggyUI 3.5 installer for clean systems is under development.**  

EggyUI 3.5 is **a non-commercial customization theme pack designed for Windows desktops**. Through innovative system-level deployment and .NET component refactoring, it significantly enhances compatibility and stability. This settings program is your essential tool for personalizing and managing its Rainmeter desktop widgets.  

**Critical Reaffirmation:**  
🔒 This project is a fan-creation for "Eggy Party":  
- **Permanently free** and **prohibits all commercial use**.  
- **Uses no decompiled game assets**; all content is original or legally obtained.  
- Any commercial use violates project licensing terms.
